perl Makefile.PL && make all test && sudo make install
# or, if you aren't rootish:
# perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/local && make all test install

# If you're missing any dependencies, "perl Makefile.PL" will let you know
# (hopefully).  Just use "cpan" to install them, and you should be ready to
# go.
